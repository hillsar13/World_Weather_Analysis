# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The  data and figures included in this repository highlight additional work on the PlanMyTrip app as requested by the client. The figures and data reflect an option to the user to include preference on minimum & maximum temperature in a world of possible travel locations. The output of user input provides potential travelers a variety of options to choose from based on their temperature preference of a location. After deciding on a location to travel, the traveler can choose 4 locations in an area and create a travel itinerary (hotel included). This is exemplified in our data example of a trip of South Africa.

## Next Steps
PlanMyTrip has a bright future ahead with continued perfecting of the app, which will only continue to allow users more self-selecting preferences on their preferred travel destinations.
